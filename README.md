# HW-1-01-HTML-CSS-and-Git-Code-Refactor

Changes to the CSS -
I cleaned up the css to bring like valued categories that had same contents into to one so that i could clean up the css
I made notes that referenced all the changes that were made inside the css

Changes to the html -
I changed some div's to nav's
changed names to the different classes to correspond to the new and updated css
I fixed the image section so that it appeared by taking away the assets folder that was dictated in the html but was not an actual folder in the assignment
<<<<<<< HEAD
I also notated the changes with comments on the line an sections that changes were made using the appropiate tagging.
