# HW-1-01-HTML-CSS-and-Git-Code-Refactor

Changes to the CSS - I cleaned up the css to bring like valued categories that had same contents into to one so that i could clean up the css
Changes to the html - I changed some div's to nav's and changed names to the different classes to correspond to the new and updated css
I also notated the changes with comments on the line an sections that changes were made in the css and html using the appropiate tagging.
